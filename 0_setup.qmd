Before the workshop starts, you'll need to install **R** (the programming language),
**RStudio** (the editor/IDE we'll use to interact with R),
and if you can, two **R packages**.

The instructions to do so follow below.

## Install R and RStudio

_There's a separate tab with instructions for each operating system:_ 

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Windows

Installation on Windows:

1. **Install R: download and run [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm)**
   **from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).**

2. **Install RStudio: Click the download button below "Install RStudio" on**
   **[this page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).**

::: callout-warning
## Install as administrator if possible
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts,
you should run the installers as administrator
(right-click on the `.exe` file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking).
Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

## Install two R packages

If you are comfortable doing so, please install two so-called R packages
(basically, add-ons to the functionality of the language)
that we will be using during the workshop, which you do as follows:

1.  Open RStudio on your computer

2.  In RStudio, find the R "Console": this is the primary tab in the (bottom) left pane

3.  Type or paste the following commands in the Console,
    pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Return</kbd>) after each:

    -   `install.packages("gapminder")`
    -   `install.packages("tidyverse")`

4.  You should see lots of text stream by in the Console while the installation is going on.
    When it's done, test that the packages were successfully installed by running:

    -   `library(gapminder)`
    -   `library(tidyverse)`
    
    The first command should produce no output, but the second should,
    similar to what's shown in this screenshot:
