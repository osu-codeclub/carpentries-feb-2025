# 2 - Vectors ------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.1 - Single-element vectors and quoting

# 2.2 - Multi-element vectors

# 2.3 - Vectorization

# Challenge 1
# A. Start by making a vector x with the whole numbers 1 through 26.
#    Then, subtract 0.5 from each element in the vector and save the result in vector y.
#    Check your results by printing both vectors.

# B. What do you think will be the result of the following operation?
#    1:5 * 1:5

# 2.4 - Exploring vectors

# 2.5 - Extracting element from vectors

# 3 - Data frames --------------------------------------------------------------
# 3.1 - Data frame intro

# 4 - Data types ---------------------------------------------------------------
# 4.1 - R's main data types

# 4.2 - Factors

# 4.3 - A vector can only contain one data type

# Challenge 2
# What type of vector (if any) do you think each of the following will produce?
# Try it out and see if you were right.
#   typeof("TRUE")
#   typeof(banana)
#   typeof(c(2, 6, "3"))
# Bonus / trick question:
#   typeof(18, 3)

# 4.4 - Automatic type coercion
# 4.5 - Manual type conversion
